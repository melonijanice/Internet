                <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
                <p>Computers connected to the <a href="#">web</a> are called clients and servers. A simplified diagram of how they interact might look like this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#" title="Click me">Clients </a>are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available
                        on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li>
                    <li>Servers are <a href="#">computers</a> that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web
                        browser.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>So what happens, exactly?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The browser goes to the <a href="#">DNS server</a>, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on (you find the address of the shop).</li>
                    <li>The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client (you go to the shop and order your goods). This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent
                        across your internet connection using TCP/IP.</li>
                    <li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a <a href="#">"200 OK" message</a>, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser
                        as a series of small chunks called data packets (the shop gives you your goods, and you bring them back to your house).</li>
                    <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you (the goods arrive at your door â€” new shiny stuff, awesome!).</li>
                </ol>

                        <p>while the server can process information in many different languages, the files that they serve to the client are always going to be some combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!</p>
